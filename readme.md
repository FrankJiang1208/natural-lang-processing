## Natural Language Processing

### This repository includes several implementations of NLP tasks, including:

- Manual implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for Part-of-Speech tagging (on the WSJ corpus)

- Named Entity Recognition using MaxEnt MM's (on the CoNLL 2003 corpus)

- NER using MaxEnt MM's, augmented with word embeddings trained on Wikipedia by Stanford's GLoVE (on the CoNLL 2003 corpus)
